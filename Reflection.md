## Final Reflection
Although I just learned OOP, I found it was really natural to build my project with OOP, which is amazing. For example, I can just use player.score to obtain the data I need. An important thing I learned in final project is that, when building a program, users' operations will change the data, and the program should also display the changed data in an appropriate way to users. From my project, I have a deeper understanding about the process, from frontend to backend, and from backend to frontend.

A difficulty I met is how to display the information to user. Since using pure text is too boring and not friendly to eyes, I decided to use ASCII art, which I've learned in homework1, to display user interface.
At first, I opened a txt file and tried to create a demo, including the dice and the score board. After several improvement, I got the final version, which looks good I guess :)

Another thing I thought it would be a huge challenge, but turned out a simple one is creating an AI player. See, games like this usually have an AI player, in case you want to play while others are busy.
I broke this into two parts. First, how to generate the best decision. Second, how to let computer do the input rather than asking user to input command.
For part1, Probability and mathematical expectation I learned from CS 5002 helped me to solve this problem. BTW, knowledge from 5001 also helped me with problems in 5002. These two courses are related, wonderful!
For part2, I found that when player2 is AI, just let the best option be the command, rather than asking for input and let computer do the input.

In the future, I want to make this visible, not just in the console. Maybe use pygame to achieve this. For now, I'm quite interested in frontend, since the output of the codes can be seen by eyes.
