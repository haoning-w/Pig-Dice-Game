# Pig-Dice-Game
This is the final project of CS 5001.

# Introduction
Pig dice game is a simple game. Two players in turn roll a die and accumulate score, the first one who scores 100 wins.

## Detailed rules:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, then scores nothing and it becomes the another player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

# Highlights
- Simple interaction. Enter 'r' to roll a dice, or enter 'h' to hold score.
- AI player. Let player2's name be AI and you can play with AI.
- Graphic user interface. Not very fancy, but can display the information smoothly.

# How to play
open pig_dice_game.py in IDE, and just run it.
